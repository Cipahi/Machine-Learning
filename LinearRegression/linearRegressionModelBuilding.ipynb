    "## <a id=\"assumption\">Assumptions of linear regression</a>\n",
    "Before we start building the model, there are several assumption underlie the regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: \n",
    "    * There is a linear relationship between predictors and the dependent variable.\n",
    "    * If not, then we probably don't want to build a \"linear\" model on it.\n",
    "2. **Normality**: \n",
    "    * The random errors $\\varepsilon_i$ are normally distributed.\n",
    "    * If not, the inference on the regression coefficients will not be valid. The distribution of all the $\\beta$'s are derived based on the normality of $y$. If $\\varepsilon_i$ is not normally distributed, since $y$ is a function of x and $\\varepsilon_i$, $y$ will not be normally distributed either. \n",
    "        * But thanks to the central limit theorem, LS estimates are still approximately normally distributed for large n. Therefore, non-normality of the data is not as serious a problem as is often perceived. Normality is a curcial assumption mainly in case of small samples in order for the normal theory inferences on the regression coefficients to be valid. \n",
    "3. **Constant Variance(a.k.a. homoscedasticity)**: \n",
    "    * This means that different values of the response variable have the same variance in their errors, regardless of the values of the predictor variables. The $\\varepsilon_i$ have a constant variance $\\alpha^2$.\n",
    "    * If the assumption is not hold, then typically $\\varepsilon_i$= SD($y_i$). It can lead to invalid inferences on the regression coefficients since the test statistics incorrectly use a common pooled MSE as an estimate of the error variance. In short, when deriving the inference on the regression coefficients, we use the constant variance assumption. If it does not hold, then the inference will not be valid. If it is not valid, we don't know which coefficient is the significant variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Independence of random errors**: \n",
    "    * This assumes that the errors of the response variables are uncorrelated with each other, i.e., no auto-correlation.  The $\\varepsilon_i$ are statistically independent.\n",
    "    * If not, the variances of $\\beta$s will be different from those under independence. Under positive autocorrelation, the true variances of the $\\beta$'s are higher.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **No or little multicollinearity**:\n",
    "    * predictors are not dependent with each other. \n",
    "    * If not, it will result in a large variance of the regression coefficients, which will make most of them turn out to be statistically nonsignificant. When calculating the covariances, we need to calculate X'X, and it will be nearly singular making it difficult to invert, which result in a large entries in the inverse matrix for $Cov(\\hat{\\beta})=\\alpha^2(X'X)^{-1}$."

    "\n",
    "which $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ is the \"true\" relationship between $X$ and $Y$. $X$ is assumed to be nonrandom. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a regression model, the predictor variables, in this case we have only 1 $x$, are assumed to be fixed and known. They are not assumed to be random. We can think of $x$ as some think we can control like in an experiment, i.e., the same value of $x$ can generate different $y$. That's why we see the error terms $\\varepsilon_i$'s as random variables. For $\\varepsilon_1$'s, it capture the difference between the predicted $y_1$ and actual $y_1$. It is a random variable since even with the same value of $x$, we can get different $y$ because of something we don't know. It maps this randomness into a real number, which is the difference.\n",

    "Therefore, all of the randomness in the model is assumed to be in the error term. The error terms $\\varepsilon_i$ are random variables that capture the difference between ($x_i, y_i$) for all i from $1,...,n$, since it map the underlying difference between each ($x_i, y_i$). The randomness is from calculating the error term using different set of observations, i.e., when we use different set of ($x_1, y_1$), the LS estimator will be different, hence our $\\varepsilon_1$ will be different. We can fully write the random variable $\\varepsilon_1$ for the difference between ($x_1, y_1$) as \n",

    "\n",
    "Since $\\varepsilon_i$'s are assumed to be independent and identically distributed(i.i.d.) with $N(0, \\alpha^2)$. It follows that the $y_i$'s are i.i.d. as well wtih \n",

    "The picture above clearly explain why LS estimators are random variables with variance and expected values. The reason behind it is that we can take different sets of oberservations to get the LS estimators, and each time the LS estimator will be different. Quoted from the ISLR book: \"The property of *unbiasedness* holds for the least squares coefficient estimates, it means that: if we estimate $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ on the basis of a particular data set, then our estimates won't be exactly equal to $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. But if we could average the estimates obtained over a huge number of data sets, then the average of these estimates would be spot on\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to explain why LS estimators are random variables is that since $y_i$'s are random variables($y_i$ are  functions of $\\varepsilon_i$'s, and $\\varepsilon_i$'s are random variable), and $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are functions of $y_i$'s. Therefore, LS estimators are random variables."

    "Ridge regression is very similar to least squares, except that the coefficients are estimated by minimizing a slightly different quantity.

The center of the ellipse is where the LS criterion is minimum and corresponds to the LS estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$. If $s$ is sufficiently large, then the result of ridge and lasso estimators will be the same as LS estimator. By adding the $L1$ and $L2$ penalty to the criterion/cost function, the lasso and ridge regression coefficient estimates are given by the first point at which an ellipse contacts the constraint region. \n",

The penalty will shrink all of the coefficients towards zero, but it will not set any of them exactly to zero, unless $\\lambda$ is very large.\n",

    "### • Checking Outliers\n",
    "Outliers are observations that deviate significantly form the fitted model, i.e. by more than two or three standard deviations. We can use deleted residual to check outliers. We calculate the difference of the original predicted $y_i$ and the $\\hat{y_{i(i)}$, which is the fitted value of $y_i$ after omitting the observation $i$ from the model. Instead of fitting model for each i, we can get the deleted residual $e_{i(i)}$ from the following equation:\n",
    "$$ e_{i(i)}=\\frac{e_i}{1-h_{ii}}$$\n",
    "A rule of thumbs to check whether the observation $i$ is an outlier is by checking whether this number exceeds 2 or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### • Checking Influential Observations\n",
    "### --- Leverage\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that $\\hat{y}=X(X'X)^{-1}X'y = Hy$ and that $trace(H)=trace[X(X'X)^{-1}X']=trace[X'X(X'X)^{-1}]=trace(I)=p+1$, where p is the number of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $i$th fitted value is given by\n",
    "$$\\hat{y_i}=h_{i1}y_i+...+h_{ii}y_i+...+h_{in}y_n $$\n",
    "which means our $i$th predicted value is a weighted sum of all $y_j$ and h_{ii} is the weight on $y_i$. If $h_{ii}$ is too large then $y_i$ can be said to have too much influence on its own fitted value. We refer to $h_{ii}$ as the **leverage** of the observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "How large must the leverage be in order for the observation to be regarded influential? Since the mean of the $h$ is $\\frac{p+1}{n}$, a rule of thumb is to declare the $i$th observation as influential if $h_{ii}$ exceeds twice this average, i.e., if \n",
    "$$h_{ii} > \\frac{2(p+1)}{n}$$. Note that since $H$ is calculated using $X$ matrix, leverage identifies those observations as influential that are outliers in the $x$-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### --- Cook's distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Cook's distance takes the effects of both $x$ and $y$ space when detecting outliers. Cook's distance is defined as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D_i = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\hat{y_j}-\\hat{y_{j(j)}})^2}{s^2(p+1)} = \\Big(\\frac{e_{i}^*}{\\sqrt{p+1}}\\Big) \\Big(\\frac{h_{ii}}{1-h_{ii}}  \\Big) $$\n",
    "We see that $D_i$ combines the outlierness of the $i$th observation in the y-space through the first term; x-space through the second term, which is an increasing function of the leverage $h_{ii}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A rule of thumb used in practice is to declare the $i$th observation as influential if $D_i>4/(n-p-1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### • Checking Multicollinearity\n",
    "### --- VIF (>10)\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is multicollinearity, it will make most of the entries in covariance matrix become large, thus the variance of each $\\beta$ become large. It will then make most of the t-statistics of each $\\beta$ become small, whcih makes most of the $\\beta$ nonsignificant. In practice, moderate multicollinearity may not be problematic. However, severe multicollinearity is a problem because it can increase the variacne of the coefficient estimates and make the estimates very sensitive to minor changes in the models, that is, when we use different data from the same population to fit the model, the coefficient is prone to change. Therefore, the result is that the coefficient estimates are unstable and difficult to interpret. Multicollinearity saps the statistical power of the analysis, can cause the coefficients to switch signs, and makes it more difficult to specify the correct model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical result of the model with multicollinearity is that most of the coefficient turn out to be statistically nonsignificant, but the overall model can be significant, i.e., the overall R-squared is high and the ANOVA F-statistics can be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deal with this problem, we can use **Variance Inflation Factors** to check whether there is mnulticollinearity present in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $R_j^2$ denote the $R^2$ from the regression of $x_j$ om all other predictors. Then *VIF_j* is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ VIF_j = \\frac{1}{1-R_j^2}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x_j$ is approximately linearly dependent on other predictors then $1-R_j^2$ will be close to 1 and so *VIF_j* will be large.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common rule of thumb is to declare multicollinearity if most of the *VIF_j* are >10"
