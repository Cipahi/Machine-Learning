# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

In the Titanic trategy, although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. The goal of this data challenge is to predict what sorts of people were likely to survive. 

This is a Getting Started competition from Kaggle. You can find more information [[here]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic#description).
