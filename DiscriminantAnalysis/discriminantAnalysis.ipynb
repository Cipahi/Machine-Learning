    "In [logistic regression](https://github.com/johnnychiuchiu/Machine-Learning/blob/master/LogisticRegression/logisticRegression.pdf), we models the probability of our response y belongs to a particular category by building a linear model of x on the log-odds of y. In discriminant analysis, instead of estimating this probability, we calculate the probability of each observation belongs to each category. It is indeed similar to [Gaussian Mixture Model](https://github.com/johnnychiuchiu/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Clustering/GaussianMixtureModel/gmm.ipynb), the difference is that in GMM we don't have the category in the response variable, but in discriminant analysis we do have it. The difference make the whole problem become more straight forward, since we don't need to use EM step to estimate the mean and variance of each group. Instead, we can use the mean and variance of each group to calculate the probability that a certain observation belongs to each cluster k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something we need to keep in mind is that discriminant analysis do not necessary use Gaussian to calculate how likelihood a certain observation belongs to different category. In the simplest form, we can calculate this likelihood (*not to be confused with maximum likelihood, the likelihood here does not related to MLE*) by calculate the Euclidean distance between the observation to the mean of each group. Also, the predictors in discriminant analysis are required to be numerical, since we cannot calculate the distance of categorical variables.\n",

The inequality $d_1 < d_2$ equals $L_1 > L_2$. Therefore, we can also use $L_i$ to get the result. It is a linear function of x, since we assume the covariance of each group is the same.
